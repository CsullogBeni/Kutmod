\section{Conclusion}
The overall outcome of our method is more than satisfying.  As we discussed before, we have used MiniSAT with ManySAT to achieve these results. It made our method better than the concurrent ones. In our study, we systematically compared the performance of the minimum case heuristic against established heuristics such as VSIDS and Jeroslow-Wang, revealing notable improvements in solving time for complex SAT instances. The next steps and our future plans will be described in the Future Work section.
