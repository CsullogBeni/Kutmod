\section{Conclusion}
The overall impression of our method is more than satisfying. We made an optimized algorithm with $n^2$ computational cost. As we discussed before, we've used MiniSAT with ManySAT to earn this result. It made our method better than the concurrent ones. The next steps and our future plans will be described in the Future Work section.
