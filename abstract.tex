\section{Abstract}
SAT is a decision problem where we need to determine whether is a given Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is satisfiable. The problem is NP-complete, which means that there isnâ€™t a known algorithm which could efficiently solves SAT problem.

The testing results of the algorithm demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy on various benchmark SAT problems. The new approach significantly reduced the runtime compared to classical methods. The potential of the algorithm is further proven by its ability to handle more complex instances.
