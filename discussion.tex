\section{Discussion}
As we saw earlier, the testing results proved that our algorithm reached better runtime and saved some hardware resources as well. We made an optimized algorithm with $n^2$ computational cost. The A* algorithm gave a good base for our work, because it worked with minimum case heuristic and it gives an optimal result. Our analysis indicates that the minimum case heuristic not only improves solving times but also enhances the robustness of SAT solvers in handling large, real-world instances, suggesting significant implications for industry applications. The potential of the algorithm is significant, and we can use it for further researches.
