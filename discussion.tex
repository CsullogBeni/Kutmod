\section{Discussion}
As we saw earlier, the testing results proved that our algorithm reached better runtime and saved some hardware resources as well. The potential of the algorithm is significant, and we can use it for further researches. The A* algorithm gave a good base for our work, because it worked with minimum case heuristic and it gives an optimal result.
