\subsection{Stochastic Boolean Satisfiability}

The article of Stochastic Boolean Satisfiability presents a connection point between a satisfiability problem and a probabilistic model. It Demonstrates how to adapt a view of satisfiability on the field of probability. SSAT in focus, a general stochastic satisfiability problem, which plays a similar role in probabilistic domains like SAT in deterministic ones.The article analyze the relationship between planning and uncertainty. Shows systematic and stochastic algorithms, for SSAT solutions. Perhaps the complexity gap between SSAT (PSPACE) and SAT (NP), is large, the article suggests, that the knowledge of SAT could be applied to the probabilistic domain.
